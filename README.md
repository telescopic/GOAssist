# GOAssist
This is a repository containing the code for our submission for the Smart India Hackathon 2020.
GOAssist is an Android app to enable smart tourism in the following steps:
1) Click a picture of a monument/landmark
2) Provide facts about the monument/landmark
3) Suggest Nearby Places to Visit.

-The Landmark Detection is done using Google Landmark Recognition API.
-Google Maps SDK for the maps activity

The app currently displays facts only for monuments and statues in GOA so please take pictures 
accordingly to acquire the correct facts.
